# Task Listing App

## Overview
The **Task Listing App** is a simple and intuitive to-do list application built using **React.js**, **Vanilla CSS**, and **Bootstrap**. This app allows users to easily add, edit, and remove tasks, as well as assign them to specific dates for better time management. 

It stores your task data in **local storage**, ensuring that your tasks are saved and accessible anytime, even after closing and reopening the browser, as long as you're using the same device.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks to your to-do list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify tasks when your plans change.
- **Remove Tasks**: Delete tasks when they are completed or no longer necessary.
- **Date Assignment**: Assign tasks to specific dates for organized scheduling.
- **Persistent Storage**: The app uses **local storage** to save your tasks, so they persist between sessions on the same device.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building the user interface and managing the state of the app.
- **Vanilla CSS**: Custom CSS for styling the app.
- **Bootstrap**: A popular front-end framework for creating responsive layouts and UI components.
- **Local Storage**: A web storage feature that allows the app to persist data between sessions on the same device.
